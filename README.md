# Credit-card-validator-system
amazing website to check if transactions done using credit cards are fraudulent or authentic
This is a Credit card validator system which i created using simple Django and an ensemble of machine learning and deep learning algorithms

the machine learning algorithms were ensembled using a technique called stacking thus having a number of weak learners and a meta learner in the structure of this algorithm.

the machine learning algorithms used include: 
- Support Vector Machine 
- Ada Boost algorithm 
- Random Forest Algorithm 
- KNN
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier
- Decision Tree algorithm
all of which are classifiers and can classifier the same data but yield different results
